5. **Market Efficiency**: Markets tend to allocate resources efficiently, but may require intervention in cases of market failure.

#### **Neuroscience**
1. **Neuroplasticity**: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.
2. **Neurotransmission**: The process by which signaling molecules (neurotransmitters) are released by neurons and bind to receptors in other neurons.
3. **Cognitive Bias**: Systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, which affect decisions and behavior.
4. **Emotion Regulation**: The process of influencing which emotions one has, when one has them, and how one experiences or expresses them.
5. **Social Brain Hypothesis**: The theory that the human brain has evolved to manage social relationships and group dynamics.

#### **Negotiation**
1. **BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)**: The best outcome one can achieve without negotiation.
2. **Interests vs. Positions**: Distinguishing between the underlying interests (needs, desires) and the stated positions (demands) of parties in negotiation.
3. **Win-Win Solutions**: Negotiating to find solutions that satisfy the interests of all parties involved.
4. **Anchoring**: The tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.
5. **ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)**: The range in which a deal is satisfactory to both parties.
