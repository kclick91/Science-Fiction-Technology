As of my last update, AWS operates in 25 geographic regions around the world. These regions are divided into Availability Zones, which are isolated locations with their own data centers, power, cooling, and networking.

Here are the current AWS regions:

1. US East (Northern Virginia)
2. US East (Ohio)
3. US West (Northern California)
4. US West (Oregon)
5. Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
6. Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
7. Asia Pacific (Osaka)
8. Asia Pacific (Seoul)
9. Asia Pacific (Singapore)
10. Asia Pacific (Sydney)
11. Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
12. Canada (Central)
13. China (Beijing)
14. China (Ningxia)
15. EU (Frankfurt)
16. EU (Ireland)
17. EU (London)
18. EU (Milan)
19. EU (Paris)
20. EU (Stockholm)
21. Middle East (Bahrain)
22. South America (SÃ£o Paulo)
23. Africa (Cape Town)
24. Africa (Johannesburg)
25. GovCloud (US-East)
26. GovCloud (US-West)

Choosing the top 5 regions for new AWS deployments requires careful consideration of several factors including geographic demand, regulatory environment, infrastructure availability, and strategic partnerships. Here are five potential new AWS regions and the reasoning behind each:

1. **Latin America (Mexico City)**:
   - Latin America is a growing market with increasing demand for cloud services. Mexico City serves as a strategic location due to its central position in the region, proximity to major markets, and improving internet infrastructure.

2. **Southeast Asia (Jakarta)**:
   - Southeast Asia is experiencing rapid economic growth, and Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, is a key business hub in the region. Establishing a region here would cater to the growing demand from businesses in Indonesia and neighboring countries.

3. **Africa (Nairobi)**:
   - Africa presents significant opportunities for cloud services as internet connectivity and digital adoption increase across the continent. Nairobi, as one of Africa's major tech hubs, offers a strategic location to serve East Africa's growing tech ecosystem.

4. **Northern Europe (Helsinki)**:
   - With the increasing demand for cloud services in the Nordic region, Helsinki emerges as a potential location due to its strategic position and strong digital infrastructure. It could serve as a gateway to the Baltic states and Russia as well.

5. **South Asia (Colombo)**:
   - Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, could serve as a strategic location for an AWS region to cater to the South Asian market. With its improving infrastructure and central location in the region, it could attract businesses from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and beyond.

These choices are based on a combination of factors including market demand, geographical coverage, strategic positioning, and potential for growth in the respective regions. However, AWS's decisions on new regions are influenced by a variety of factors including customer demand, regulatory considerations, and infrastructure availability, so actual choices may vary.
