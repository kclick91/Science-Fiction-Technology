As of my last update, AWS operates in 25 geographic regions around the world. These regions are divided into Availability Zones, which are isolated locations with their own data centers, power, cooling, and networking.

Here are the current AWS regions:

1. US East (Northern Virginia)
2. US East (Ohio)
3. US West (Northern California)
4. US West (Oregon)
5. Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
6. Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
7. Asia Pacific (Osaka)
8. Asia Pacific (Seoul)
9. Asia Pacific (Singapore)
10. Asia Pacific (Sydney)
11. Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
12. Canada (Central)
13. China (Beijing)
14. China (Ningxia)
15. EU (Frankfurt)
16. EU (Ireland)
17. EU (London)
18. EU (Milan)
19. EU (Paris)
20. EU (Stockholm)
21. Middle East (Bahrain)
22. South America (São Paulo)
23. Africa (Cape Town)
24. Africa (Johannesburg)
25. GovCloud (US-East)
26. GovCloud (US-West)

Choosing the top 5 regions for new AWS deployments requires careful consideration of several factors including geographic demand, regulatory environment, infrastructure availability, and strategic partnerships. Here are five potential new AWS regions and the reasoning behind each:

1. **Latin America (Mexico City)**:
   - Latin America is a growing market with increasing demand for cloud services. Mexico City serves as a strategic location due to its central position in the region, proximity to major markets, and improving internet infrastructure.

2. **Southeast Asia (Jakarta)**:
   - Southeast Asia is experiencing rapid economic growth, and Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, is a key business hub in the region. Establishing a region here would cater to the growing demand from businesses in Indonesia and neighboring countries.

3. **Africa (Nairobi)**:
   - Africa presents significant opportunities for cloud services as internet connectivity and digital adoption increase across the continent. Nairobi, as one of Africa's major tech hubs, offers a strategic location to serve East Africa's growing tech ecosystem.

4. **Northern Europe (Helsinki)**:
   - With the increasing demand for cloud services in the Nordic region, Helsinki emerges as a potential location due to its strategic position and strong digital infrastructure. It could serve as a gateway to the Baltic states and Russia as well.

5. **South Asia (Colombo)**:
   - Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, could serve as a strategic location for an AWS region to cater to the South Asian market. With its improving infrastructure and central location in the region, it could attract businesses from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and beyond.

These choices are based on a combination of factors including market demand, geographical coverage, strategic positioning, and potential for growth in the respective regions. However, AWS's decisions on new regions are influenced by a variety of factors including customer demand, regulatory considerations, and infrastructure availability, so actual choices may vary.

# Storing Data Outside the Universe

Storing data outside our universe is a fascinating theoretical concept that crosses the boundaries of computer science, physics, and cosmology. This idea essentially requires us to transcend the physical constraints of our universe, which presents profound challenges.

## Top 10 Challenges of Extra-Universal Data Storage

1. **Fundamental Physical Barriers**  
   Our universe appears to be a closed system with specific physical laws and constants. Any information would need to exist in some form of physical substrate, but "outside" our universe may not have compatible physics or substrate to encode information.

2. **Causal Disconnection**  
   If we define "outside the universe" as causally disconnected from our spacetime, then by definition we cannot send or receive signals to/from such a region. This creates a fundamental retrieval problem.

3. **Interface Problem**  
   Creating an interface between our universe and an external realm would require establishing a connection across whatever boundary separates them—potentially requiring manipulation of space-time at quantum scales or higher dimensions.

4. **Quantum Information Preservation**  
   Quantum information cannot be copied perfectly (no-cloning theorem), and quantum states are extremely fragile. Transferring quantum data across universal boundaries would likely introduce decoherence or information loss.

5. **Energy Requirements**  
   The energy needed to create a bridge or portal to an external realm would likely be astronomical, possibly requiring exotic matter with negative energy density or manipulation of higher dimensions.

6. **Signal Transmission**  
   Even if we could establish some connection, sending signals across universal boundaries would require an entirely new physics of information transmission not bound by our universe's speed of light or causality constraints.

7. **Time Synchronization**  
   Different cosmic domains might experience time differently or not experience time at all. This creates enormous challenges for coordinating write/read operations and ensuring data remains accessible.

8. **Data Integrity Verification**  
   How would we verify that data remains unchanged when stored outside our physical laws? Standard checksums and error correction may be meaningless in a realm with different mathematical foundations.

9. **Access Protocol Development**  
   Creating reliable protocols for data retrieval from extra-universal storage would require solutions to problems we cannot fully conceptualize within our understanding of physics.

10. **Ontological Paradoxes**  
    If information exists outside our universe but can affect events within it, this creates potential causality issues that might fundamentally undermine the coherence of such a system.

These challenges represent not just engineering problems but potentially insurmountable physical limitations based on our current understanding of reality. The most promising theoretical approaches might involve quantum gravity theories, multiverse concepts, or entirely new paradigms in information theory.
