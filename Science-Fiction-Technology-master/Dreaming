That’s a fascinating premise! If people share a dream world but have independent realities, the fundamental nature of existence would be radically different from our own. Here are 15 speculative properties of such a universe:

1. **Dream Consensus Reality** – The dream world would act as a stable, persistent universe where all minds connect. It may have fixed laws or be malleable based on collective subconscious influence.

2. **Solipsistic Waking Life** – Each person’s reality while awake is entirely their own, with no objective existence outside their perception. If they perceive someone, that entity is a mental construct, not an independent being.

3. **Temporal Fluidity in Dreams** – Since dreams are shared, time in the dream world may be more stable than in waking life, allowing for a sense of history, continuity, and societal progression.

4. **Personalized Physics in Reality** – Individuals might have different physical laws in their own waking worlds—one person might experience gravity normally while another might float, depending on their perception.

5. **Dream Economy** – Since the dream world is the shared reality, economies, trade, and social structures would exist primarily within dreams, and waking life would be an isolated personal experience.

6. **Memory Conflicts** – People might not remember their personal realities the same way; instead, they would anchor their understanding of existence in the shared dream world.

7. **Identity Uncertainty** – Waking life would lack a solid sense of external validation, making identity unstable. Only in dreams could people confirm they exist to others.

8. **Death as Awakening** – Instead of traditional death, individuals might simply "log out" of the shared dream permanently, leaving behind only memories in the collective subconscious.

9. **Variable Dream Influences** – The dream world could be influenced by the strongest minds, meaning powerful dreamers shape the environment, events, and even history.

10. **Dream Diplomacy** – Disputes would be settled in the dream world rather than in waking reality since no two people physically exist in the same universe outside of it.

11. **Infinite Waking Realities** – Each waking person might construct their own universe, meaning there could be infinite variations of existence, all isolated from each other.

12. **Dream-Only Technology** – Inventions and knowledge would only be meaningful within the dream world, leading to a civilization that advances entirely within dreams.

13. **Echoes of Dream Interaction** – If someone builds an object in a dream, they might wake up with the illusion of having a version of it in their own reality, even if it's entirely subjective.

14. **Dream Cities and Nations** – People would congregate in dream-created locations, forming civilizations based on shared subconscious experiences rather than physical locations.

15. **Waking Isolation & Dream Community** – In waking life, people might crave returning to the dream world, where relationships, adventures, and society exist, making personal reality feel like a lonely waiting period.

This setup creates a universe where the dream world is the true home of humanity, while waking life is just a fleeting, private experience with no shared continuity. What do you think? Would you want to explore this kind of setting in a story?
