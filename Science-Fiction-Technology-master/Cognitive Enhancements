"Now as an engineer design a robot based on this ranked list."
ChatGPT
Great—designing a robot based on this ranked list means creating a cognitive architecture that prioritizes which abilities the robot can *directly control* and which should *emerge or be influenced* by lower-level processes, just like in humans.

Let’s call the robot **CORTEX-25**.
