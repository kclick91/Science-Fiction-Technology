The most used equations in engineering can vary depending on the specific field or application, but here are five fundamental equations that are widely used across different branches of engineering:

1. **Newton's Second Law of Motion**: F = ma
   This equation relates the force applied to an object, its mass, and the resulting acceleration. It's foundational in mechanics and dynamics.

2. **Ohm's Law**: V = IR
   Ohm's Law describes the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in an electrical circuit. It's fundamental in electrical engineering.

3. **Euler's Formula**: e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i*sin(θ)
   Euler's formula relates complex numbers to trigonometric functions and is extensively used in electrical engineering, signal processing, and control theory.

4. **The Ideal Gas Law**: PV = nRT
   This equation describes the behavior of an ideal gas under varying conditions of pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and the amount of substance (n). It's crucial in thermodynamics and chemical engineering.

5. **The Fourier Transform**: F(ω) = ∫f(t)e^(-iωt)dt
   The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time or space into its constituent frequencies. It's essential in signal processing, telecommunications, and many other fields.

As for the projected most used equations in 25 years, it's challenging to predict with certainty, given the rapid pace of technological advancements and emerging fields. However, some potential candidates might include equations related to:
