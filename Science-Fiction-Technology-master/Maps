"Based on the real observable universe, imagine a new universe and develop a map for it."
ChatGPT
Let's imagine a new universe, different yet inspired by the structures and phenomena of our own observable universe. We’ll call this new universe **“The Erythraean Expanse”** — a vast cosmos with its own unique features, regions, and cosmic entities.

### **1. The Core Domain: The Pyros System**
- **The Star of Aeldra**: A massive blue supergiant star that is the central beacon of the Pyros System. It radiates intense ultraviolet light, which energizes nearby nebulae and creates stunning cosmic light shows. The star is unstable, frequently ejecting solar flares and forming temporary miniature stars in its close vicinity.
